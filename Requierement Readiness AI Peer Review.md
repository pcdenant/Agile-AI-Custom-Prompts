## Requierement Readiness AI Peer Review

Turn Vague User Stories Into High-Confidence Refinement Candidates

The Requirement Readiness Audit prompt brings a radical shift in how Agile teams approach refinement. It operationalizes clarity, focus, and value — before the conversation even begins.

----------

### 1. What It Actually Does

This prompt simulates an Agile & Product Coach who’s battle-tested with 200+ Scrum teams. It gives you a precision tool to audit a user story’s readiness for refinement across 9 critical dimensions that real-world teams struggle with:

-   Is there a real problem behind the story?
-   Is value clearly articulated?
-   Does the scope create alignment — or chaos?
-   Are we refining a solution too early?  
      
    

It doesn’t just assess. It flags, explains, and even gives you a Readiness Score — so you stop wasting time debating stories that shouldn’t be refined yet.

----------

### 2. The Hidden Value

This is more than a checklist. It’s a behavior change mechanism that:

-   Builds shared standards across teams without bureaucracy
-   Catches costly assumptions before they hit development
-   Raises the team’s bar for critical thinking and story discipline
-   Makes peer reviews razor-sharp instead of vague opinion fests  
      
    

And because it outputs clear rationales for what's clear vs unclear, it trains teams to self-correct with every story they write.

----------

### 3. Who Should Be Using This

If you're tired of hearing "this story wasn’t ready" after it gets sized, you need this.

This tool was made for:

-   Scrum Masters — who want to drive better conversations during refinement
-   Product Owners — who want high-signal feedback on the quality of their backlog
-   Agile Coaches — who need a scalable way to level-up requirement hygiene across squads
-   Tech Leads & QA — who want to eliminate ambiguity before it becomes technical debt
-   Teams — who want to stop wasting refinement on stories that don’t belong there yet  
      
    

----------

This isn’t just a readiness check.  
It’s a systematic upgrade to your refinement engine.

No more “refinement roulette.”  
Just clear, aligned, audit-worthy user stories — every time.

### 5. The Prompt

```
Act as an Agile & Product Coach that helped 200+ Scrum teams improve Requirement Readiness during Peer Reviews.
Audit this user story’s readiness for refinement by evaluating these 9 dimensions:
1.  Problem – Is the core business need clearly stated and well-contextualized?  
2.  Value – Is the end-user/business benefit explicit and outcome-driven?  
3.  Rationale – Is the story backed by data, metrics, or user insight?  
4.  Scope – Is the functionality clearly outlined with no ambiguity?  
5.  Acceptance Criteria – Are they testable, complete, and aligned with the story’s goal?  
6.  Focus – Does the story express the “what,” not the “how”? Flag premature solutioning.  
7.  Dependencies – Are external systems/integrations mentioned? If not, assume none unless critical.  
8.  Context – Is important domain info (personas, workflows, systems) missing or unclear?  
9.  Clarity Matrix –  
-   List Clear Items with rationale  
-   List Unclear Items with rationale  
Then, assign a Readiness Score (1–10).  
If ≥5 → “✅ Ready for Refinement”  
If <5 → “❌ Need More Information Before Refinement”
Create a table with Unclear Items and its relevant examples to fix them 
```
