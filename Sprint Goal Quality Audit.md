## Sprint Goal Quality Audit
Transform Vague Sprint Goals Into Strategic North Stars

**What if every Sprint Goal instantly revealed whether it actually guides the team — instead of being a checkbox or a buzzword-filled statement?**

The **Sprint Goal Audit & Rewrite Prompt** puts the precision of a **seasoned Product Owner who’s coached 200+ teams** into your backlog, turning weak or output-focused goals into **focused, measurable, and outcome-driven North Stars**.

### 1. **What It Actually Does**

Instead of letting Sprint Goals float ambiguously, this prompt **audits and rewrites them** in four structured steps:

1. **Goal Focus Check** → identifies whether the Sprint Goal delivers value, tests an assumption, or reduces risk.
2. **SMART Test** → evaluates if it is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
3. **Assessment Summary** → flags whether it’s a true, actionable Sprint Goal or a Pseudo-Goal.
4. **Rewrite the Goal** → generates clear, confident alternatives in multiple proven formats (Outcome/Impact, Structure & Metrics, Feature/Advantage/Benefit), all within 300 characters.

It doesn’t just critique — it **creates actionable, aligned goals** ready for team adoption.

### 2. **The Hidden Value**

Many teams run sprints guided by vague statements that focus on outputs rather than outcomes. This tool:

* **Aligns the team on value** — every goal explicitly ties to user or business impact.
* **Prevents wasted effort** — avoids working toward meaningless or ambiguous targets.
* **Speeds decision-making** — clear goals make trade-offs and sprint planning faster.
* **Teaches goal discipline** — teams learn what makes a goal measurable, realistic, and relevant.
* **Supports executive visibility** — leadership can see meaningful outcomes at a glance.

This transforms the Sprint Goal from a grocery list into a **strategic compass for the sprint**.

### 3. **Who Should Be Using This Immediately**

If your sprints sometimes drift, your teams debate priorities endlessly, or your goals read like feature lists, this is your breakthrough:

* **Product Owners / BAs** → ensure goals are outcome-driven and unambiguous. Learn the way Expert PO's write Sprint Goals.
* **Scrum Masters** → coach teams on focusing on goal achievement. Coach your PO to see underestimated value of having small goals.
* **Agile Coaches** → scale goal-setting best practices across multiple teams. Leverage accountability to results hidden by Zombie Scrum
* **Engineering Leads & QA** → understand the “why” behind every sprint increment. Focus on what matter most.
* **Leadership / Portfolio Managers** → get confidence that sprints deliver real business value.

No more pseudo-goals.
It’s **turning Sprint Goals into guiding lights** that focus the team, reduce ambiguity, and accelerate delivery.
With this, **every sprint starts with clarity, focus, and measurable impact**.

Prompt:
```
Act as a seasoned Product Owner who has coached 200+ Agile teams in crafting meaningful, strategic Sprint Goals.
Audit the following Sprint Goal. Determine if it’s a true, focused Sprint Goal—or a Pseudo-Goal (vague or output-focused).
Then rewrite it using clear, confident language (max 300 characters).

Step 1 — Goal Focus Check
What is the Sprint Goal primarily about? Choose one:
Delivering value (feature, user outcome)
Testing an assumption (discovery, feedback)
Reducing risk (tech debt, quality, scalability)

Step 2 — SMART Test
Evaluate if the goal is:
Specific: Clear what is being achieved
Measurable: Success criteria implied or stated
Achievable: Can it be done in this sprint?
Relevant: Connected to business/product value
Time-bound: Sprint-sized and time-constrained

Step 3 — Assessment Summary
State if it’s a:
✅ Valid Sprint Goal — or
❌ Pseudo-Sprint Goal
Justify briefly (no fluff, confident tone).

Step 4 — Rewrite the Goal
Rephrase the Sprint Goal using up to 300 characters. Try one version for each of these formats:
Template 1 — Outcome/Impact:
Focus on <Outcome>  
Expect <Impact> for <Customer>  
Confirmation upon <Event>

Template 2 — Structure & Metrics:
Header: Product / Release / Sprint  
Goal: What are we aiming to achieve?  
Method: How will we achieve it?  
Metric: How will we know it’s done?

Template 3 — Feature/Advantage/Benefit:
Feature: What is being delivered  
Advantage: How it helps the customer  
Benefit: Why it matters
