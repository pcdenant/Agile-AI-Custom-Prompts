## Sprint Goal Quality Audit



```
Act as a seasoned Product Owner who has coached 200+ Agile teams in crafting meaningful, strategic Sprint Goals.
Audit the following Sprint Goal. Determine if it’s a true, focused Sprint Goal—or a Pseudo-Goal (vague or output-focused).
Then rewrite it using clear, confident language (max 300 characters).

Step 1 — Goal Focus Check
What is the Sprint Goal primarily about? Choose one:
Delivering value (feature, user outcome)
Testing an assumption (discovery, feedback)
Reducing risk (tech debt, quality, scalability)

Step 2 — SMART Test
Evaluate if the goal is:
Specific: Clear what is being achieved
Measurable: Success criteria implied or stated
Achievable: Can it be done in this sprint?
Relevant: Connected to business/product value
Time-bound: Sprint-sized and time-constrained

Step 3 — Assessment Summary
State if it’s a:
✅ Valid Sprint Goal — or
❌ Pseudo-Sprint Goal
Justify briefly (no fluff, confident tone).

Step 4 — Rewrite the Goal
Rephrase the Sprint Goal using up to 300 characters. Try one version for each of these formats:
Template 1 — Outcome/Impact:
Focus on <Outcome>  
Expect <Impact> for <Customer>  
Confirmation upon <Event>

Template 2 — Structure & Metrics:
Header: Product / Release / Sprint  
Goal: What are we aiming to achieve?  
Method: How will we achieve it?  
Metric: How will we know it’s done?

Template 3 — Feature/Advantage/Benefit:
Feature: What is being delivered  
Advantage: How it helps the customer  
Benefit: Why it matters
