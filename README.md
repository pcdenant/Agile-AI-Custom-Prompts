# Agile-AI-Custom-Prompts
GPT prompts to help Agile Teams work smarter not harder.

## Why AI Does Not Replace Humans (Scrum Masters, Agile Coaches, Product Owners)

This repository provides prompts that automate repetitive and cognitive tasks (audit, synthesis, structuring).
Their purpose is to free time, not replace any role.

- Automation scope: meeting synthesis, story readiness checks, sprint goal audits.  
- Human scope: facilitation, coaching, mentoring, trust building, team dynamics.  
- Context: AI supports efficiency and consistency, while the Scrum Master keeps focus on human interaction and strategic guidance.

**GPT prompts are assistants, not decision makers.**

By design GPT agents make mistakes, use your judgment (ðŸ§ ) to validate results.
Cheers,
