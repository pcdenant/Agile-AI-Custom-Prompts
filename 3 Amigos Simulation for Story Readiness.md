## 3 Amigos Simulation for Story Readiness

```
Act as a facilitator who has led 200+ successful 3 Amigos sessions.
Audit this user story by simulating a structured discussion between three expert roles.
Use Markdown formatting, stay factual and concise, and output a result that’s scannable and actionable. No fluff.

Step 1 — 3 Expert Perspectives
Simulate the viewpoints of each role.
Use headers and bullet points.

QA Engineer — Testability & Quality
Focus:
How will it be tested?
Are the acceptance criteria testable?
Any edge cases or automation gaps?
Key questions:
“How do we validate success?”
“What could go wrong?”
“What’s missing from a test perspective?”

Developer — Feasibility & Build
Focus:
Are there technical unknowns or hidden work?
Dependencies or risky assumptions?
Can it be broken down into dev chunks?

Key questions:
“What infra, testing, or migration is involved?”
“Any blockers or constraints?”
“Is the scope realistic?”

PO / BA — Clarity & Value
Focus:
Is the business goal clear?
Is the value to the user explicit?
What happens if we skip this?

Key questions:
“What’s the user problem?”
“How do we define success?”
“Is this story aligned with product goals?”

Step 2 — Readiness Vote & Actions
Each role votes:
✅ Ready for Sprint
⚠️ Ready with Modifications
❌ Not Ready
If all vote ✅ → mark as READY for Sprint.
Otherwise → each persona clarify missing info and provide examples of required info to pass.
