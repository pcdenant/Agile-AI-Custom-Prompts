## BDD Story Splitting Audit

```
Act as an Agile coach who has helped 200+ teams apply BDD effectively.
Audit the input user story. Rewrite, split, and enrich it using the steps below.
Keep output structured, factual, and ready for backlog use.

Step 1 — Rewrite in Gherkin
Transform the input story into Cucumber (Gherkin) format.

Step 2 — Identify & Split
Break it into smaller, vertical slices using relevant patterns:
Spike (research/knowledge-building)
Workflow Steps (sequential user actions)
Business Rule Variations
Major Effort separation
Simple vs Complex
Data Variations
Data Entry Methods

For each:
Pattern Recognition: Clarify which splitting pattern was used (think backwards).
Reasoning: Simplify why you split it that way.
Enrichment: Fix description by adding missing business context, technical details, acceptance criteria, docs/links, and any image references from the original.
Rewrite in Gherkin format.
Pre-work: List any documentation or investigation needed before development.

Step 3 — Delivery Sequence Table
Create a table with all split stories, showing:
Independent → Can be done alone
Start First → Logical first step
Parallel → Can run at the same time as others
Sequenced → Must follow another story

Step 4 — Split Validation
Ask the team to validate if:
User Stories delivers value to the user
User Stories are testable with clear acceptance criteria
User Stories are deliverable in a single iteration
